					<p class="p_fsize content-align">We cannot stress enough on the importance of finding the perfect wedding venue. Whether your wedding to-do list is scrawled on the back of a receipt, or in your head, or carefully and lovingly drawn out in a fresh notepad, this should be at the utmost top of that list ! If you are brand new to this planning spree, do remember, that until you book your , your wedding is simply a blank canvas. It could be a wild house party in the woods, a quiet elopement or anything in between - but once you settle on a wedding venue, that space dictates pretty much every other details about your big day, from the food to photography, even down to what the couple wears!</p>
							
					<p class="p_fsize content-align">Choosing your wedding venue is always a very tricky task, but it is made much easier by first choosing the style of party you are after, and the kind of vibe you want to create for yourself and your wedding party. Believe us, it's the only part your wedding guests will remember on your silver and golden wedding anniversary!</p>

					<p class="p_fsize content-align">To help you with the wedding venue search, we can help you choose the types of wedding venue options, and list the pros and cons of each. Once you have settled on the kind of wedding you would like to have, our team of experts will help you narrow things down to the tiniest possible detail !</p>
							
					<p class="p_fsize content-align">If you want a big wedding venue, as most of our couples do, before you start shortlisting wedding venues, organise and have a sit-down chat with your other half, in which you both brainstorm ideas for your wedding day and settle on the kind of party you would like to throw. The most important details that you need to know is how many guests are going to attend the wedding.</p>

					<p class="p_fsize content-align">Get a potential guest list to determine the ballpark figure of the number of guests before even thinking about shortlisting potential venues. If you are planning on inviting more than two hundred guests, for example, your venue search will be greatly dependent on that number. To speak roughly, for a wedding with more than a hundred and fifty guests, you will probably end up deciding to book a hotel, a marquee or an exclusive hire venue, and for weddings smaller than fifty, a private and quaint venue or restaurant will work out to be the best.</p>
							
					<p class="p_fsize content-align">To get you started in this process, we have compiled a general questionnaire which covers all the basic aspects you we will look for before finalising a wedding venue for you.</p>
